# <strong>Analysis-economics-about-Upwork</strong>
The exploratory study of an online platform of freelancers. We chose Upwork, a digital platform whose objective is to match freelance independent workers 
(e.g. consultants, IT developers) with companies looking for highly targeted skills. 
The platform allows companies to "post" their offers and then freelancers to contact these companies and possibly start a collaboration. 
The platform offers various services to facilitate this contact. In particular, it offers an assessment service for self-employed workers. 
Our objective is to make an exploratory analysis of the following questions:  

    1.Describe the typical profiles of companies and self-employed people contacting the platform.
  
    2.Identify the determinants of the rating performed by the platform. 
  
    3.Identify the determinants of the price of the service as well as the method of remuneration (fixed or variable payment)
